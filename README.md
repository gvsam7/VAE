## Description

Test platform to validate generative models using 4 datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and STL10).
The first model is a variational autoencoder comprised of convolutional and fully connected layers.
The purpose of this code is to become a testing platform where various generative models will be tested in
the 4 datasets.
The datasets were chosen based on their complexity.
